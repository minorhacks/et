# ET

ET is a an **e**rror **t**agging library that allows errors to be wrapped with
custom tag strings, where these tags exist in their own custom namespaces.

## Why?

This is experimental code written to explore the behavior/limitations of Go
generics, and is not representative of any actually good/sound ideas.
